Execute the simulation from this directory with the following command line. 

java -cp bin Simulation

If you want to alter the logging behaviour (e. g. to set the logging level from
"INFO" to "FINE") use the following command line.

java -cp bin -Djava.util.logging.config.file=logging.properties Simulation

Note: Log level "FINE" is good for debugging, but produces *a lot* of output
      and is therefore quite slow in execution.
